# CppProjects
A collection of my C++ work.

Assignment 1 covers some C++ basics such as reading from files, entering debug mode, and arithmetic.

Assignment 2 covers the OOP basics such as classes, as well as addresses and pointers.

Assignment 3 covers the usage of timers, inline functions, and overloading operators.

Assignment 4 covers other OOP features such as polymorphism and inheritence. 

Each assignment folder contains a make folder.

The Exercises folder contains smaller exercises I did throughout the course, and covers all the concepts that the above assignments covered.
